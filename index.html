    <p >This is <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> icon here. Ruby on Rails or RoR is a web development <em>framework</em>. It is based on MVC style and is very popular and easy to use. The framework itself is based on the Ruby language, commonly referred to as R (learn more about it by clicking on the image above). </p>
    
    <p>There a number of reasons why RoR is useful, and include: </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Efficiency</li>
      <li>Fast execution</li>
      <li>Ability to write code quickly</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can learn more about RoR on their website which can be found 
      <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">here.</a>  <!-- target attribute here instructs open in new window -->
    </p>

    <h2 id ="competitors">Direct Competitors:</h2>
    <p>There are a number of direct competitors to RoR to choose from in the market. They include the following:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Django (Python framework)</li>
      <li>ASP.NET (a framework of C#) </li>
      <li>Node.js</li>
      <li>Express</li>
      <li>Spring Boot</li>
      <li>Laravel</li>
      <li>Flask</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now as you may have (should have? ;) ) noticed, they aren't based on the Ruby language. However, some developers still prefer RoR because it is possible to set up a working website quickly when using RoR.</p>
